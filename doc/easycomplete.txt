EasyComplete                                                     *easycomplete*

===============================================================================

Introduction

Vim-Easycomplete is a fast code completion plugin for vim/nvim. In order to
provide the best performance and experience. I remove all non-essential
requirements and environment dependencies so that it has minimum redundancy.

It requires vim script only, and you don't even have to add one line of
configuration if you want. It's definitely a minimalism style plugin.

Vim-Easycomplete is easy to install and use. It contains these features:

- Buffer keywords and dictionary support
- Directory and file completion support
- Goto definition support for all languages
- Language lint with diagnostic
- Signature helper
- LSP support
- LSP Server installation with one command
- Snippet support with ultisnips. (python3 required)

===============================================================================

Installation

Easycomplete requires Vim 8.2 and higher version with MacOS/Linux/FreeBSD.
For neovim users, 0.4.4 is required (Of course, latest is recommended).

Configuration

It use Tab to trigger completion suggestions. You can change this setting by

  let g:easycomplete_tab_trigger="<c-space>"

There are four build-in popup menu themes for default styles confliction: `dark`,
`light`,`rider` and `sharp`. (`let g:easycomplete_scheme="sharp"`). This config 
can be ignored in most cases.

===============================================================================

Useage

You can use Tab to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere. Alse use Tab and
Shift-Tab to select matched items. Use `Ctrl-]` for definition jumping, `Ctrl-t`
for jumping back (Same as tags jumping). 

Or you can use `:EasyCompleteGotoDefinition` command.

Use `:EasyCompleteNextDiagnostic` and `:EasyCompletePreviousDiagnostic` for
diagnostics jumping. For example, map diagnostic jumping to `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` >

  nnoremap <silent> <C-j> :EasyCompleteNextDiagnostic<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <C-k> :EasyCompletePreviousDiagnostic<CR>

In most cases, the plugin already map these tow HOTKEYs for you successfully. You
only have to set custom diagnostic HOTKEYs manually in case of there was a conflict.

Checking if LSP server is installed via `:EasyCompleteCheck`. If current LSP
Server is not ready, Use `:EasyCompleteInstallServer` to install.

Typing `./` or `../` to trigger directory completion suggestion.

Dictionary suggestion support via `set dictionary=${Your_Dictionary_File}` if
you need.

Typing `:h easycomplete` for help.
